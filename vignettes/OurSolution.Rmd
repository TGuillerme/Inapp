## What we count
The problem with the Fitch is that it counts steps.

We get around this by counting homoplasies.
See De Laet's work on this.

The total score = steps + (additional) regions.

Here's an example tree showing that.

### What does it take to denote separate regions?
- Three inapplicable tips, arranged just so.
(Addresses Goloboff's comment.)

## How this fixes the problem

Here are some examples of how this fixes the problems that we encountered.

Take the example of two very different tails.  Because they are so different,
it makes sense that they might have evolved twice.


## Furhter examples

Here are Goloboff's trees as examples of how we would approach them, and why that's preferable to how he would approach them

Here are De Laet's cases and here's why they aren't problematic.


## Summary

<!--
For the first process, denote for each tip whether it has an applicable token, an inapplicable token, or both, and use the standard Fitch algorithm to reconstruct the state of each internal node, reconstructing ambiguous nodes on the uppass as applicable".  (It might not take more than another sentence or two to put this clearly enough that a non-initiated reader could understand it.)
-->

We can show that this produces the correct behaviour.  But how do we count this in practice?
