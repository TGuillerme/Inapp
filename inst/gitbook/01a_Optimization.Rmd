## Optimizing ambiguous characters characters

A number of approaches have been proposed concerning which resolution of ambiguous
nodes is preferable.

The two most familiar approaches to resolving ambiguous node are the Accelerated Transformation
(<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">AccTran</span>) and Delayed Transformation 
(<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">DelTran</span>) approaches.

- Acctran vs Deltran: Neither is guaranteed to always maximise homology
- With transformational characters, there's no way to decide.
- With neomorphic characters though, we want to assume the minimum number of innovations of the innovation.
- This is what we mean by maximising homology: always assume a neomorphic character is present if you can
- Here's how we'd resolve the ambiguous trees from [@Agnarsson2008].
