# Inapplicable data in a parsimony setting

This is one of a series of vignettes that works through the inapplicable algorithm proposed by Brazeau _et al._ [-@ThisStudy].

We assume that you'll already have read [Fitch.Rmd].

## Problems with the Fitch algorithm

This file essentially replicates [@Maddison1993].


### Red tails, blue tails

### Why Reductive coding doesn't work

### Why Extra State doesn't work

### Why all-in-one-character doesn't work
i.e. tail: (0) absent, (1) present, red; (2), present, blue

### Why Sankoff matrices don't work

#### Practical reasons
 - Exponentiallt big if lots of dependent characters
 - As soon as they get large, discovering a new state means loads of work
 
#### Fundamental reasons
 - The more fundamental reason is that even a Sankoff doesn't work properly!
