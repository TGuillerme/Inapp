# Inapplicable data in a parsimony setting

This is one of a series of vignettes that works through the inapplicable algorithm proposed by Brazeau et al [@ThisStudy].

We assume that you'll already have read [Fitch.Rmd], [Problems.Rmd] and [FailedSolutions.Rmd].

## What we count
The problem with the Fitch is that it counts steps.

We get around this by counting homoplasies.
See De Laet's work on this.

The total score = steps + (additional) regions.

Here's an example tree showing that.

### What does it take to denote separate regions?
- Three inapplicable tips, arranged just so.
(Addresses Goloboff's comment.)

## How this fixes the problem

Here are some examples of how this fixes the problems that we encountered.

## Furhter examples

Here are Goloboff's trees as examples of how we would approach them, and why that's preferable to how he woudl approach them

Here are De Laet's cases and here's why they aren't problematic.


## Summary

We can show that this produces the correct behaviour.  But how do we count this in practice?
