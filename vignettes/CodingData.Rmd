# Inapplicable data in a parsimony setting

This is one of a series of vignettes that works through the inapplicable algorithm proposed by Brazeau et al [@ThisStudy].

We assume that you'll already have read [OurAlgorithm.Rmd].

## How this algorithm weights against multiple innovations

- We saw in an earlier section that step counts can be avoided by causing multiple innovations
- Our algorithm counterbalances that by charging a levy for each innoation of the parent character
- This has a side-effect that we'll study with an invariant character

## Multiple dependencies

It's not a problem to have characters dependent on characters that are dependent on characters.
This is our chance to respond to Goloboff's point 6.


## A parsimony uninformative character that informs parsimony!

- All tails are blue.  Let's say that they are all blue for some complex molecular reason
- This complex molecular reason is grounds to suspect that the tails have a common ancestor
- More formally, we wish to attribute this complex molecular reason to common ancestry, rather than homoplasy
- Thus "blueness" represents a separate character that has the same distribution as tails (or a sbuset thereof, if some tails are of uncertain colour)

- We should include this character if it's meaningful.  But not if it's not (e.g. number of base pairs in a tail).


## Separate handling of neomorphic and transformational characters
### The situation
- One sort of character that would not be meaningful is a neomorphic character.  
- Neomorphic characters are asymmetrical.
- Let's imagine a silly example to illustrate the case.  Let's say that none of the tails in our dataset have laser-firing capability.  (This is probably true for all datasets that include taxa with tails.)
- It would be silly if a character "Lazer firing ability: (0) absent" made us more likely to group tails
  together as having a common ancestry, particulalry if this means that another organ (wings perhaps) would have to have multiple origins
- On the other hand, if all the tails in our dataset DID have laser firing abilities, we might want a character
  "laser firing ability (1) present" to require an explanation by common ancestry - that is, to serve as evidence that the observed tails had a single evolutionary origin

### Recommendation
- Neomorphic characters should be ABSENT everywhere they are absent, whether this is because there's no tail or because there's a tail without a ray gun.
- Transformational characters need our algorithm though.

### Difficulties
Here are some marginal cases where discretion is required.
Here are some trees that show why we would code things our way
this is why you need to look at your data carefully and see whether you like what your mode of coding is implying!
