# Inapplicable data in a parsimony setting

This series of vignettes works through the inapplicable algorithm proposed by Brazeau _et al._ [-@ThisStudy].

## The packages

Illustration of the inapplicable algorithm is based on the [Inapp](https://github.com/TGuillerme/Inapp) `R` package.
This package allows to visualise how the algorithm is counting the score of a tree for a given character with different algorithms treating inapplicable data differently.
It allows users to input any tree and character.

To actually perform tree search, pleas have a look at the [inapplicable](https://github.com/ms609/inapplicable) `R` package.
This package is currently in development but allows some heuristic searches on reasonable sized matrices.

Both these `R` packages are based on the [morphylib](https://github.com/mbrazeau/morphylib) `C` library that allows to score characters with inapplicable using our new algorithm.
This library will be eventually implemented in [Morphy](http://www.morphyproject.org/), a fully functional `C` based API for phylogenetic searches.
