# Inapplicable data in a parsimony setting {-}

This document provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm for handling
inapplicable data proposed by Brazeau _et al._ [-@ThisStudy].

We first discuss how the [Fitch algorithm](../fitch.html) works and introduce
the [problems](problems) that it encounters in the face of inapplicable character states.

We then introduce our [solution](solution.html), a new [algorithm](algorithm.html), implemented in
various [software packages](software.html), and discuss its
implications for the coding of [characters](coding.html) and [ambiguity](ambiguity.html).

We close with some [example](examples.html) trees that demonstrate how our algorithm behaves in more complicated cases.
