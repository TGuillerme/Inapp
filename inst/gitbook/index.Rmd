# Inapplicable data in a parsimony setting {-}

This document `r if(knitr::is_latex_output()) "(also available as an [HTML webpage*](https://rawgit.com/TGuillerme/Inapp/master/inst/gitbook/_book/index.html)"` provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm for handling
inapplicable data proposed by @Brazeau2018.

We first discuss how the [Fitch algorithm](#fitch) works and introduce
the [problems](#problems) that it encounters in the face of inapplicable character states.

We then introduce our [solution](#solution), a new [algorithm](#algorithm), implemented in
various [software packages](#software), and discuss its
implications for the coding of [characters](#coding) and [ambiguity](#ambiguity).

We close with some [example](#examples) trees that demonstrate how our algorithm behaves in more complicated cases.
