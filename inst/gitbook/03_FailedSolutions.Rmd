<!-- # Inapplicable data in a parsimony setting

This is one of a [series](Index.html) of vignettes that works through the inapplicable algorithm proposed by Brazeau _et al._ [-@ThisStudy].

We assume that you are already familiar with the [Fitch algorithm](Fitch.html)
and its [shortcomings](Problems.html). -->

## Counting steps is doomed

Plenty of people informally have attempted to solve the problem by counting steps. (E.g. that U of Texas PhD that we found; goloboff pers. comm.?)

It'll never work. here's why.

One example: multiple independent gains are preferred because they avoid adding steps.
