# Inapplicable data in a parsimony setting {-}

This document provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm for handling
inapplicable data proposed by Brazeau _et al._ [-@ThisStudy].

We first discuss how the [Fitch algorithm](../fitch) works and introduce
the [problems](problems) that it encounters in the face of inapplicable character states.

We then introduce our [solution](solution), a new [algorithm](algorithm), implemented in
various [software packages](software), and discuss its
implications for the coding of [characters](coding) and [ambiguity](ambiguity).

We close with some [example](examples) trees that demonstrate how our algorithm behaves in more complicated cases.
