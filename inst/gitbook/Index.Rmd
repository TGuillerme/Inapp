# Inapplicable data in a parsimony setting

This document provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm for handling
inapplicable data proposed by Brazeau _et al._ [-@ThisStudy].

We first discuss how the \@ref(fitch)[Fitch algorithm] works and introduce
the \@ref(problems) that it encounters in the face of inapplicable character states.

We then introduce our \@ref(solution), a new \@ref(algorithm), implemented in
various \@ref(software)[software packages], and discuss its
implications for the coding of \@ref(coding)[characters] and
\@ref(ambiguity).

We close with some \@ref(example) trees that demonstrate how our algorithm behaves in
more complicated cases.
